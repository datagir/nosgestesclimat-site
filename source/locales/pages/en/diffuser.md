# Disseminate Nos Gestes Climat

Nos Gestes Climat is a public service, its code <a href="/documentation">is free</a> and reusable by everyone.

However, you can take advantage of and distribute our simulator in several ways without mobilizing development skills.

## You want to share a page in a specific language

Since the version <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/nouveaut√©s/glacier-du-g√©ant">Glacier du G√©ant</a>, the interface of the Nos Gestes Climat website is translated into several languages. You can therefore share a page of the site in a specific language by indicating at the end of the the URL `?lang=en`.

For example, to share the page _/diffuser_ in English :

`https://nosgestesclimat.fr/diffuser?lang=en`

The currently supported languages are French (`fr`) and English (`en`).

> Note that when you change the interface language, the model of calculation remains unchanged. Only the website's text is translated.

## You want to integrate the simulator directly on your site

Nothing could be easier! Integrate it in a blog post or a website simply by adding the line below to your web page.

<script id="nosgestesclimat" src="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/iframe.js"></script>

Join <a href="https://datagir.ademe.fr/apps/nos-gestes-climat/">the many current reusers</a>.

The module will automatically stay up to date with the <a href="/nouveaut√©s">latest developments</a>.

To learn more about the integration, visit <a href="https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/blob/master/PERSONNALISATION.md">our guide</a>.

## You host climate conferences

To spice up a conference and get your listeners active on their phones, what better way than to let them do a live simulation?

You want to estimate the climate footprint of a group of people, or simply integrate the simulator and retrieve the simulation result in the user's account?

The "conference" and "survey" features are now available!

Go to <a href="/groupe">üèüÔ∏è group mode</a> on choose a room name, share the link, and launch the simulation game!

## You want the same calculator tailored to your country

We are looking for native partners to translate and adapt the GHG emissions model for the specificities of other countries.

## You want to customize the tool for your own needs

To learn more about custom integration (configured iframe, code fork), visit <a href="https://github.com/datagir/nosgestesclimat-site/blob/master/PERSONNALISATION.md">our customization guide</a>.

## You just want to help us

Contributions are free. We are looking for :

-   people who like to juggle physical units and model calculations by finding the best available data sources
-   developers and designers to improve the site, its design and its features

Everything is on <a href="https://github.com/datagir/?q=nosgestesclimat&type=&language=&sort=">Github</a>, but feel free to contact us directly.
