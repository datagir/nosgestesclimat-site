# My oil and gas footprint

Among the greenhouse gases that are warming the climate, carbon dioxide CO‚ÇÇ and methane CH‚ÇÑ are the most prominent. Our consumption of oil and gas is responsible for a large portion of the emissions of these greenhouse gases.

For every liter of fuel (e.g. oil in a car, but also kerosene in an airplane), about 2.5 kg of CO‚ÇÇ are released into the atmosphere. Thus, for a <a href="https://nosgestesclimat.fr/documentation/p√©trole/volume-plein">50 L car fill-up</a>, 125 kg of CO‚ÇÇ are emitted.

> In other words, it only takes one full tank of fuel per month to already almost reach one's <a href="https://datagir.ademe.fr/blog/budget-empreinte-carbone-c-est-quoi/">annual carbon budget</a>.

But well before the CO‚ÇÇ emitted during the combustion of oil and gas that makes your car go and heats your home, let's not forget the _upstream_, before combustion happens in the engine or boiler: extraction, refining, transport at various stages and especially by truck to the gas stations, are all steps that require energy or cause methane emissions.

We have therefore added to the result bar of Nos Gestes Climat **an estimate of gasoline fill-ups** that corresponds to your lifestyle.

## Beyond Climate üó∫Ô∏è

Reducing oil and gas consumption is therefore necessary for the climate. But as we often say, "climate's not our only problem": geopolitics and national security and strategy also are crucial matters, because we have little or no oil and gas on the French territory.

Furthermore, like any fossil resource, oil and gas stocks will not be renewed in our lifetime, nor in the lifetime of our great-grandchildren: global tensions on demand may strongly affect our economy, whose energy consumption is mostly fossil (oil and gas).

<a href="https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2119697">According to INSEE,</a> in 2021, 37% of our energy consumption was source from Africa (12% from Algeria, 11% from Nigeria, 10% from Libya), 23% from the former USSR, including 9% from Russia**, and 15% from the Middle East, including 8% from Saudi Arabia.

## The case of Russia's war in Ukraine üá∫üá¶

On February 24, 2022, <a href="https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_de_l%27Ukraine">Russia launched a military operation in Ukraine</a>, which is the largest military operation happening in Europe since the end of World War II.

France expresses <a href="https://www.gouvernement.fr/info-ukraine">unequivocal support for Ukraine</a>, and <a href="https://www.diplomatie.gouv.fr/fr/dossiers-pays/ukraine/guerre-en-ukraine-la-position-de-la-france/article/guerre-en-ukraine-la-position-de-la-france">adopts</a> a policy of "[...] sanctions decided to produce a massive effect on the Russian economy" to "[...] increase the price of war and influence the choices of the Russian president", supported at the European level by the <a href="https://france.representation.ec.europa.eu/informations/leurope-peut-elle-se-passer-du-gaz-russe-2022-07-25_fr">REPowerEU plan</a> to **free the European Union from its dependence on Russian gas by 2027**.

These sanctions are justified by the fact that half of Russian exports are <a href="https://fr.statista.com/infographie/26880/commerce-international-russie-exportations-petrole-gaz-balance-commerciale/">oil and gas</a>.

This news **has led us to urgently launch this "oil consumption" display in Nos Gestes Climat in March 2022**.
